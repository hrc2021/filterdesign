## Fitler Design 
This project began as a desing project as part of lab work for Linear Circuits class taught by Professor Hartnett.
Currently the project has the following functionality:
- Designs Full Filters
  - Includes Chebyshev, and Butterworth
- Design SallenKey Specs for the Filters
  - Low, High and Band pass filters
- Graph the Frequency Response for the Filters

The commandline functions can be found in their corrisponding README.md files under each directories folder.
In addition, these functions can be run out of the root folder, if you run startup.m
