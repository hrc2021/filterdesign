## Fitler Design 
This project began as a desing project as part of lab work for Linear Circuits class taught by Professor Hartnett.

At the begining, when you open the folder with all the functions, run the following
```
startup.m
```
Sometimes it does automaticaly, other times it does not.

Currently the project has the following functionality:
- Designs Full Filters of Analog and Digital
  - Includes Chebyshev, and Butterworth
- Design SallenKey Specs for the Filters
  - Low, High and Band pass filters
- Graph the Frequency Response for the Filters

The commandline functions can be found in their corrisponding README.md files under each directories folder.
In addition, these functions can be run out of the root folder, if you run startup.m
